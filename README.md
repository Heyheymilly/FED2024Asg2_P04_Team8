MokeSell is a user-friendly online marketplace that combines the best features of popular e-commerce platforms like Carousell, Lazada, and Shopee while introducing unique improvements. Designed to enhance the buying and selling experience, it integrates loyalty rewards, gamification, and a seamless shopping interface. Our approach focuses on user convenience, allowing customers to browse, buy, and interact. With an intuitive design, a comfortable color scheme, and engaging features like a spin-the-wheel reward system, MokeSell aims to provide a streamlined, enjoyable, and efficient shopping experience.
Additionally, we carefully selected a color scheme that enhances user comfort and usability, setting our app apart visually. The design choices and feature integrations were made strategically to maximize user satisfaction and functionality. By blending elements from different apps with our own innovative ideas, MokeSell introduces a fresh, refined approach that aims to redefine the online marketplace experience.


# Design Process
We placed the rewards on the home page, as the rewards are given daily. It makes it easier for the user to not forget to claim their reward
The home page acts as a directory; so each page goes back to the first and the user can choose where to go from there.
Using Firebase for authentication and database management, along with JavaScript and Chart.js for interactivity, we ensured the platform was functional, scalable, and responsive across devices.

Cloudinary (https://cloudinary.com/)
Cloudinary is an excellent tool for storing images in the cloud and retrieving to the firebase database, since firebase storage has become a paid feature, this is an excellent alternative to achieve the outcomes of the website

CSS
CSS is an amazing coding langauge that has a great deal of flexibility in designing websites to however the user wants it to be

Javascript
Javascript is another excellent coding language to implement the unique and different front end features to make websites coded seem like they have backend features, despite it being only in the front end, an excellent language for those who has just started with front end development

HTML
HTML is the perfect language for this project as it is able to seemlessly connect the design features of the CSS and the website extra functionalities of the javascript, allowing a functional website to be built without any backend technologies like node.js
